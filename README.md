## Add more resources

If you want to see other Telegram resources in this list, please open new PRs adding them. Follow these rules:
- Be sure your channel/group fits the requirements. It should:
  - use the English language only,
  - relate to the topics (DevOps, SRE, and/or Platform Engineering),
  - be public (you don't need to join it to see the messages),
  - have recent messages,
  - not be overfilled with sponsored/biased/spam messages (including endless free offers, vague job offers, and so on).
- Find a proper category for your addition and make a brief description similar to the existing entries.
- Make a separate PR per each addition.
- All decisions on accepting new entries are at the repo maintainers' discretion.
